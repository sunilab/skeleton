# skeleton

The skeleton application attempts to bridge the gap between UX designers using the Sketch App tool and the UI developers developing the UI from the design in the Sketch App.

The applications goal is to make it easy for UI developers to get the structural and styling information out of the Sketch file and into a rough HTML structure (hence the name skeleton).

The application is based on a set of rules, that convert specific layers into HTML elements and apply the layer styles to these HTML elements.

The applications primary use case scenario is for building individual components. The initial release of the application will support React components.

Use the 'npm run build' command from the react-app-template application to compile the React application and deploy it to this node app.
